## 🔎 Overview

Microsoft Excel includes a suite of financial functions designed to solve common problems related to loans, savings, investments, and asset depreciation. This repository explains how to use each function step by step. 🧮

**Typical use cases:**
- 🏠 Calculate loan payments and schedules (mortgages, car loans, etc.)
- 📈 Determine present or future value of investments
- 💼 Analyze cash flows for business decisions
- 🧾 Calculate depreciation for accounting
- 💹 Compute profit margins

## 💰 Key Financial Functions

### 💸 PMT (Payment)

Calculates the periodic payment for a loan or investment based on constant payments and a constant interest rate.

**Syntax:**  
`=PMT(rate, nper, pv, [fv], [type])`

- `rate` – Interest rate per period (annual rate/number of periods per year).
- `nper` – Total number of payment periods.
- `pv` – Present value (principal).
- `fv` – [optional] Future value (remaining balance after last payment, usually 0).
- `type` – [optional] 0 (end of period), 1 (beginning of period).

**Example:**  
Monthly payment for a $185,000 loan, 7% annual interest, 15 years:  
`=PMT(7%/12, 15*12, -185000)`

---

### 📈 RATE (Interest Rate)

Returns the interest rate per period for an investment or loan.

**Syntax:**  
`=RATE(nper, pmt, pv, [fv], [type], [guess])`

**Example:**  
Find the interest rate for a loan with known payment, periods, and present value.

![RATE Example](Screenshots/Rate.png)

[Official Docs: RATE](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/rate-function-9f665657-4a7e-4bb7-a030-83fc7b1c44b4)

---

### 📅 NPER (Number of Periods)

Returns the number of payment periods for an investment or loan.

**Syntax:**  
`=NPER(rate, pmt, pv, [fv], [type])`

**Example:**  
Find the number of periods.

![NPER Example](Screenshots/Nper.png)

[Official Docs: NPER](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/nper-function-948cdf64-9e4d-4c7c-8d3d-e273f8f1a5d8)

---

### 💵 PV (Present Value)

Returns the present value of an investment or loan.

**Syntax:**  
`=PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])`

**Example:**  
Here its the ammount we borrowed.

![PV Example](Screenshots/Pv.png)

[Official Docs: PV](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/pv-function-23879d31-0e02-4321-be01-da16e8168cbd)

---

### 🔮 FV (Future Value)

Calculates the future value of an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate.

**Syntax:**  
`=FV(rate, nper, pmt, [pv], [type])`

**Example:**  
Future value of monthly investments.

![FV Example](Screenshots/Fv.png)

[Official Docs: FV](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/fv-function-3a7c2c97-4fdd-4d9d-8d7b-c6b5adf6c1b6)

---

### 🏦 PPMT (Principal Payment)

Returns the payment on the principal for a given period.

**Syntax:**  
`=PPMT(rate, per, nper, pv, [fv], [type])`

- `per` – Specific period for the calculation.

**Example:**  
Principal paid in the 5th year of a loan.

![PPMT Example](Screenshots/Principal.png)

[Official Docs: PPMT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/ppmt-function-0214da64-9a63-4996-bc20-214433fa6441)

---

### 💳 IPMT (Interest Payment)

Returns the interest payment for a specific period.

**Syntax:**  
`=IPMT(rate, per, nper, pv, [fv], [type])`

**Example:**  
Interest paid in the 5th year of a loan.

![IPMT Example](Screenshots/Interest.png)

[Official Docs: IPMT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/ipmt-function-0214da64-9a63-4996-bc20-214433fa6441)

> ℹ️ *Note: the principal part and the interest part always add up to the payment amount.*

---

## 🧑‍💼 Advanced Scenarios

### 🪙 Compound Interest

Calculate the result of compounding interest over multiple periods.

**Formula:**  
`=Principal * (1 + rate/nper)^(nper*years)`

**Example:**  
Future value of $10,000 invested at 8% compounded annually for 5 years.

![Compound Interest Example](Screenshots/Compound.png)

---

### 📊 CAGR & RRI

#### 🧮 RRI (Equivalent Interest Rate)

Returns the equivalent interest rate for the growth of an investment.

**Syntax:**  
`=RRI(nper, pv, fv)`

- `nper` – Number of periods
- `pv` – Present value (negative)
- `fv` – Future value

**📈 CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  
The CAGR measures the growth of an investment as if it had grown at a steady rate on an annually compounded basis. 

**Example:**  
Annual rate needed for $10,000 to grow to $14,693.28 in 5 years.

![CAGR Example](Screenshots/Cagr.png)

### 📉 NPV & IRR

#### 💹 NPV (Net Present Value)

Calculates the net present value of an investment based on a discount rate and future cash flows.

**Syntax:**  
`=NPV(rate, value1, [value2], ...)`

**Note:** Subtract initial investment separately.

**Example:**  
Discount rate 12%, Cash flows: Period 0: -100, Period 1: 0, Period 2: 50, Period 3: 150. 

![NPV Example](Screenshots/Npv.png)

[Official Docs: NPV](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/npv-function-8672cb67-2576-4b67-99cd-911d0a96614c)

#### 🚦 IRR (Internal Rate of Return)

Calculates the internal rate of return for a series of cash flows.

**Syntax:**  
`=IRR(values, [guess])`

![IRR Example](Screenshots/Irr.png)

> ℹ️ *Note: The IRR rule states that if the IRR is greater than the required rate of return, you should accept the project. IRR values are frequently used to compare investments.*
